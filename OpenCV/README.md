# FVV CALIBRATION

## Chessboard's corners
The scripts in here are for getting the corner pixel positions and generating matches and pairs with them once the OpenMVG reconstruction is done.

* **Corners Extraction:** The script *corners_feat_file.py* generates a txt file, with extension .feat (it is what OpenMVG ask for). Those files, one per frame, contains the pixel coordinates of each corner.
  * **DESC files:** OpenMVG needs a descriptor file for each feat file. These files are generated by copying the ones already generated by OpenMVG, with a bash script (*see utils_bash*).
* **Matches & Pair files:** Using the IDs that OpenMVG gave to each frame, the matches and pair files are generated.
